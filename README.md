# Videoretrieval
The project aims to enable users to quickly find specific target information in stored videos, such as events, people, animals, vehicles (including license plates), time and location, etc., by speeding up the video retrieval process.
Project functionality overview
Video frame extraction:

Extract still frames from video files for further processing and analysis.
Users can set the frequency of frame extraction to control the number of frames extracted per second.
Target Detection:

Use the YOLOv8 model for target detection to identify and label different targets (such as people, animals, vehicles, etc.) from each frame.
Output the target information detected in each frame, including target category and location information.
Feature extraction:

Image features are extracted from each frame using a CLIP model to facilitate subsequent image retrieval and comparison.
The extracted features can be used for similar image retrieval to help users find similar scenes in videos.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Use the BERT model for text processing and named entity recognition (NER) to extract key information (such as names, places, events, etc.) in video descriptions.
Supports extracting key information from text descriptions to facilitate users to query video content through natural language.
Speech Recognition:

Use speech recognition technology to convert voice input into text, enabling voice queries for video content.
The recognized text can be further processed and analyzed to extract key information.
Multimodal query:
